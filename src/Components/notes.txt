1) create login screen
2) created register screen
3) created the Homepage as Navabar name
4) just the thing is misbehaving is when i logged in => if i refresh the page its log out automatically
    =>solution for this is : use the local storage to store the isloggedIn state or other states because the state is resets to
    its default after we refresh the page
